# Contributing to The PAST Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to The PAST Framework.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Open an issue describing what's unclear, incorrect, or could be improved
- Include specific sections or page references where applicable

### Suggesting Improvements

- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b improvement/description`)
- Make your changes
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of what you changed and why

### What We're Looking For

- **Real-world case studies** — Have you applied PAST in your organization? Share what happened.
- **Worksheet improvements** — Better templates, additional exercises, clearer instructions
- **Translations** — Help make the framework accessible in other languages
- **Corrections** — Typos, broken links, unclear language

### What Doesn't Fit

- Tool-specific recommendations (the framework is deliberately tool-agnostic)
- Promotional content for specific vendors or platforms
- Changes that fundamentally alter the framework's four elements (Purpose, Audience, Scope, Tone)
